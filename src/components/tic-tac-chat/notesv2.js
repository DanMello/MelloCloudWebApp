            Fixed issue where if a user created a game and closed laptop or
            locked their phone screen the game would never be deleted and would
            be stuck on the list of games even if no one was in there. The
            solution for this was to create a TTL index (Time To Live) in
            mongodb that deletes any game after 10 mins of inactivity. Every
            time you make a move or send a message or any other interaction that
            makes a server call, the time of the index will be updated. The game
            will only get deleted if you do nothing for 10 minutes.

            There is a new option available in game after you create or a join a
            game called "More options" which allows you to.
            <ul className={"tic-tac-notes-ul"}>
              <li className={"tic-tac-notes-li"}>
                If you are the host you can kick the other player by clicking
                the "Kick Player" button under the players name in the "Players"
                section.
              </li>
              <li className={"tic-tac-notes-li"}>
                If you are the host can you invite another player if the game is
                not full via sms or email by entering in their info under
                "Invite Players" section and clicking the send invite button.
                Numbers cannot contain parenthesis or dashes and must be a 10
                digit number from one of the 4 major providers ATT, Verizon,
                Sprint or T-mobile.
              </li>
              <li className={"tic-tac-notes-li"}>
                If you are the host you can make the game private by clicking on
                the checkbox next to "Private Game" under "More Settings".
                Private games will not show up on the list of games and players
                can only join via invite.
              </li>
              <li className={"tic-tac-notes-li"}>
                If you are not the host and you go to "More options" you will be
                able to see the list of players in the game.

        <div className={"tic-tac-notes-heading-2"}>Implementations</div>
        <ul className={"tic-tac-notes-ul"}>
          <li className={"tic-tac-notes-li"}>
            Text messages are sent from nodemailer with the email
            mellocloudsoftware@gmail.com. I store the 4 main SMS gateway domains
            in a array: ATT, Verizon, T-mobile and Sprint. Then loop through
            them sending the message to each one, which ever provider contains
            the number will deliver the message. Then the implementation goes as
            follows.
          </li>
          <ol className={"tic-tac-notes-ul"}>
            <li className={"tic-tac-notes-li"}>
              The text message contains a link to a sub domain
              (game.mellocloud.com) which handles all api calls for
              tic-tac-chat. The link contains a query string with a gameId and a
              one time token along with a message saying you have been invited
              to play tic-tac-chat.
            </li>
            <li className={"tic-tac-notes-li"}>
              Once the link is clicked the backend will check if the game is
              still available, that it is not full and that the link has not
              been used yet. If any of these are true you will be redirected to
              the tic-tac-chat page with an error in the query string that gets
              displayed on the screen. After that the backend removes the token
              from the database and generates a random username, clientID and
              another token. The backend then stores the new username, clientID
              and token in the document with the gameId from the link along with
              some other info like the move (X or O) based on the other user in
              the document. After that the backend redirects the user to the
              front-end with the new username, clientID, token, and current
              gameId in the query string.
            </li>
            <li className={"tic-tac-notes-li"}>
              Once you reach the front-end with all that new information in the
              query string you will be connected to the WebSocket with that new
              clientID that was made for you. The clientID is just used to
              differentiate users in the WebSocket. Then the front-end will
              check if you already had a username stored in a cookie from before
              and if so it will use that instead of the random username created
              earlier. A message gets sent to the WebSocket called
              'joinFromInvite' and it passes all this new info clientID,
              username from server and username from your browser cookie, token
              and gameId. The WebSocket then checks if the game still exist and
              not full and if this token has been used yet which like before
              will redirect with error if so. Then it removes the token from the
              document so it cant be used again and checks if a username was
              passed from the front-end (the one from the cookie) if so it
              updates the game changing the old username that was generated to
              the one you already had from before. After that the WebSocket puts
              you in the game and lets the other user know you joined and thats
              pretty much it.

              The email message works the same way, I just wanted to talk a
              little about this implementation because I thought it was cool and
              its the most complicated thing about the new update!
